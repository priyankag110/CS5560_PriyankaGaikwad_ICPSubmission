The clinical relevance of molecular biomarkers in oncology management has been recognized in breast and lung cancers.
We evaluated a blood-based multigene assay for management of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) in a real-world study (U.S.registry NCT02270567).
Diagnostic accuracy and relationship to clinical disease status in two cohorts (treated and watch-and-wait) were evaluated.
Patients with NETs (.
NETest diagnostic accuracy was 96% and concordant (95%) with image-demonstrable disease.
Scores were reproducible (97%) and concordant with clinical status (98%).
The NETest was the only feature linked to PFS (odds ratio, 6.1; .
Blood NETest is an accurate diagnostic and can be of use in monitoring disease status and facilitating management change in both watch-and-wait and treatment cohorts..
A circulating multigene molecular biomarker to guide neuroendocrine tumor (NET) management has been developed because current biomarkers have limited clinical utility.
NETest is diagnostic (96%) and in real time defines the disease status (>95%) as stable or progressive.
It is >90% effective in guiding treatment decisions in conjunction with diagnostic imaging.
Monitoring was effective in watch-and-wait or treatment groups.
Low levels supported no management change and reduced the need for imaging.
High levels indicated the need for management intervention.
Real-time liquid biopsy assessment of NETs has clinical utility and can contribute additional value to patient management strategies and outcomes..
